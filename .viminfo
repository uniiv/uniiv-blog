	## Versioning
	
	For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Ghost will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.
	
	Releases will be numbered with the following format:
	
	`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`
	
	Constructed with the following guidelines:
	
	* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.
	* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.
	* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
	* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.

	## Getting Started
	
	There are **two** main ways to get started with Ghost, take care to use the method which best suits your needs.
	
	270
<**Please note** - the downloadable zip files we provide on [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download) are pre-built packages designed for getting started quickly. Cloning from the git repository requires you to install several dependencies and build the assets yourself. 
	
	### Getting Started Guide for Bloggers
	
	If you just want to get a Ghost blog running in the fastest time possible, this method is for you.
	
	For detailed instructions for various platforms visit the [Ghost Installation Guide](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/). If you get stuck, help is available on [our forum](http://ghost.org/forum/).
	
	1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Ghost requires **Node v0.10.**
	1. Download the latest Ghost package from [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download). 
	   **If you cloned the GitHub repository you should follow the instructions [for developers](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#getting-started-guide-for-developers).**
	1. Create a new directory where you would like to run the code, and unzip the package to that location.
	1. Fire up a terminal (or node command prompt in Windows) and change directory to the root of the Ghost application (where config.example.js and index.js are)
	1. run `npm install --production` to install the node dependencies. If you see `error Error: ENOENT` on this step, make sure you are in the project directory and try again.
	1. To start ghost, run `npm start`
	1. Visit `http://localhost:2368/` in your web browser or go to `http://localhost:2368/ghost` to log in
	
	Check out the [Documentation](http://docs.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.
	
	
	
	### Getting Started Guide for Developers
	
	If you're a theme, app or core developer, or someone comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.
	
	If you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.
